# KlebNET-Metadata-Repository-Database

The KlebNET Metadata Repository Database houses metadata associated with publicly available _Klebsiella_ whole genome sequences. It is the result of a community-driven data curation effort to facilitate the use and reuse of public genome collections for maximum knowledge gain. These efforts are focussed on _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ and closely related organisms in the _K. pneumoniae_ Species Complex (KpSC) and are coordinated by the [KlebNET-GSP](https://klebnet.org/) project team. 

The KlebNET Metadata Repository Database is available for secondary analysis according to the principles of the [PHA4GE Microbial Data Sharing Accord](https://pha4ge.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/PHA4GE_Microbial_Data_Sharing_Accord_v1.0.pdf), with the exception of Clause 3: Onward sharing of data as inclusion of this database in external platforms is allowed so long as this statement is included; exception of Clause 2: Overview of Outputs prior to Publication which is required for only a subset of the data; and exception of Clause 7: Opportunity for Collaboration which is required for only a subset of data. The `PHA4GE accord` column indicates the clauses that apply to each isolate represented in the Respoitory; `PHA4GE v1.0 -3` indicates that PHA4GE accord version 1.0 applies with the exclusion of clause 3; `PHA4GE v1.0 -3,-7` indicates that PHA4GE accord version 1.0 applies with the exclusion of clauses 3 and 7; `PHA4GE v1.0 -3,-2,-7` indicates that PHA4GE accord version 1.0 applies with the exclusion of clauses 3, 2 and 7 etc. 

Metadata fields are described in the associated [scheme repository](https://github.com/klebgenomics/Klebsiella-genome-metadata).
